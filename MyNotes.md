# BASICS

## Why selenium?

1. Open source and free.
2. Supports many programming languages and IDEs

## Types

1. Seleniumn IDE - 
    1. Record and playback
    2. No programming knowledge required
    3. Works only on mozilla firefox.
    4. Cannot reuse recorded scripts for other similar tasks(eg - new scripts requried for each new item purchased)
    5. Large number of scripts mean more overhead for maintanence 
    6. No integration with other tools
2. Selenium Webdriver
    1. Requires programming
    2. Costomizable in terms of browsers, machines, OS, programming language
    3. Easy to maintain

3. Selenium Grid
    1. Parallel tests to be run in multiple machines

## Pre-Requisites for setting up Selenium Webdriver

### Setting up Eclipse IDE

1. Download Selenium webdriver
2. JUnit jar file
3. JRE addition and eclipse setup

### Unit test framework
A unit testing framework is a class library that contains definitions of reusable classes, annotations and methods that you can use in your automation script to eliminate coding tasks for

Defining the execution sequence

Structuring and grouping test activities like test set up tasks, test closure tasks, test reporting, etc. for easy maintenance of large test suites.

Since we have chosen Java as our programming language, in this course, we will use the simplest unit testing framework available for Java called ‘JUnit’.
